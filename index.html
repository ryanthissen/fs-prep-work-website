      <h3>Early Life</h3>
      <p>I grew up in a small town in the California Central Valley.  As a youth, I played soccer, baseball, and basketball.  My first job was scooping ice cream at Baskin-Robbins.  After high school, I attended Fresno State to study Civil Engineering.</p>

      <h3>College</h3>
      <p>While not studying, I was busy at my fraternity and going to Fresno State football games.  I made many friends in college that will be with me my whole life.  I was hired as a student at the California Department of Public Health to help staff engineers inspect public water systems.</p>

      <h3>Post-College</h3>
      <p>I worked three years in Sacramento following graduation.  I then moved to Alameda where I would later meet my wife.  Her work brought us first to Dublin, then back to the Central Valley.  Then mid-2016, we moved back to the East Bay, where I eventually came across Galvanize.</p>
